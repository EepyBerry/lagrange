A WebGL side-project using VueJS and ThreeJS! <br>
Lagrange is a browser application to help you create your own planets, using procedural noise as a foundation to build upon.

**🪐✨ [Check out the app here!](https://lagrange.eepyberry.me) ✨🪐**

_(**note:** this is something I am working on during my free time, which means that update frequency will vary!)_

## ⚠️ Requirements

### **IMPORTANT:** to properly run the application, a **graphics card of any kind** as well as [**WebGL 2.0 browser support**](https://get.webgl.org/webgl2/) are required! <br>

### Browser compatibility/implementation issues:

- On some Linux-based systems, there is an issue with Firefox not being able to initialize the WebGL context properly, thus leading to the following GLSL error:

  ```
  THREE.WebGLProgram: Shader Error 0 - VALIDATE_STATUS false

  Material Name:
  Material Type: MeshStandardMaterial

  Program Info Log: Statically used varyings do not fit within packing limits. (see GLSL ES Specification 1.0.17, p111)
  ```

  If this happens, please try using another browser before submitting an issue. Thanks <3

## ⚙️ Installation & building

For more details on the commands themselves, check the [package.json](https://github.com/EepyBerry/lagrange/blob/main/package.json) file.

### Run locally

Clone the repository then use the following commands:

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the application locally: `npm run dev` / `npm run dev-host`

Lagrange runs on port 5173 by default; `dev-host` exposes the application to the local network.

### Build project

Building is done with the following command:

- `npm run build`

Vite copies the output to the `dist` folder, creating it first if need be.

## 📋 Current Features

### Codex

- 📋 Create, import & export your planets! (now set as the landing page)
- 🔎 See previews of your creations!

### Editor

- ☀️ **Lighting parameters!** (sunlight, ambient light)
- 🌍 **Planet & Rendering parameters!** (transform, PBR, water level)
- 🗺️ **Surface parameters!** (bumps, noise settings, color)
- ⛰️ **Biome parameters!** (🚧)
- ☁️ **Clouds parameters!** (transform, color, opacity)
- 🌈 **Atmosphere parameters!** (density, color)

## ⏰ Planned features

- More biomes!
- Cracks & Craters!
- Gas Giants!
- _Galactic Map_, to organize them around stars!

## ✨ Inspirations

This project is heavily inspired by the awesome projects below:

- [PlanetMaker Chrome Experiment](https://planetmaker.apoapsys.com) (2013, Kevin M. Gill)
- [NASA's Eye on Exoplanets](https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/exo/#/) (Unknown date, NASA)
