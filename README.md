A WebGL side-project using VueJS and ThreeJS! <br>
Lagrange is a browser application to help you create your own planets, using procedural noise as a foundation to build upon.

_(**important note:** this is something I am working on during my free time, which means that update frequency will vary!)_

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & building

For more details on the commands themselves, check the [package.json](https://github.com/EepyBerry/lagrange/blob/main/package.json) file.

### Run locally

Clone the repository then use the following commands:

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the application locally: `npm run dev` / `npm run dev-host`

Lagrange runs on port 5173 by default; `dev-host` exposes the application to the local network.

### Build project

Building is done with the following command:

- `npm run build`

Vite copies the output to the `dist` folder, creating it first if need be.
