A WebGL experiment using VueJS and ThreeJS! <br>
Lagrange is a browser application to help you create your own planets, using procedural noise as a foundation to build upon.

This project is heavily inspired by the awesome [PlanetMaker Chrome Experiment](https://planetmaker.apoapsys.com) (2013, Kevin M. Gill)!
